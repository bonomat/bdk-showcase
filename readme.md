# Showcase of a potential bug?

When generating a wallet from an extended private key (xprv) a wallet generated using bdk>19 is different to a wallet generated using bdk=19.

Run with `cargo run` and check output of different versions.

tested with: 
`rustc 1.62.0 (a8314ef7d 2022-06-27)`
`cargo cargo 1.62.0 (a748cf5a3 2022-06-08)`
